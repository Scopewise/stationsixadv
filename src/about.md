<div class="about-content">

StationSixADV is a field journal. Not a blog. Not a media brand.

It exists because some experiences don't fit in a photo caption, and some lessons only become clear in the writing of them.

The rider behind it has been in the seat long enough to know what matters and what doesn't. Long enough to stop performing for anyone.

This is a place to think out loud about what it means to ride well — not fast, not far, not dangerously — but with judgment, attention, and care.

If something here sounds familiar, it probably is.
