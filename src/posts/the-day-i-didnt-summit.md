The forecast said clear. The road said otherwise — not dramatically, not with the kind of weather that gives you a story to tell. Just fog that didn't lift, and a decision point at 9,000 feet where the trail became a suggestion.

I sat with the engine off for five minutes. Listened to nothing in particular. Counted the reasons to keep going. Counted the reasons to turn back.

The turning-back reasons weren't louder. They were just more honest.

There's a version of this story where I summit and feel good about myself. I've told that version before. This isn't it.

This is the version where I rode back down in better spirits than I rode up, because I stopped lying to myself about what I was actually trying to prove.

The ridge line will be there. Or it won't. Either way, I'll be better prepared to read it next time.
